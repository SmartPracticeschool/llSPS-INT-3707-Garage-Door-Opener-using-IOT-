Hello Folks :)

Here is my project based on IOT garage opening with the following features:-

1) Stream live video to the web using flask(with face detection)

2) Open the garage door whenever it recognises the correct Car number plate. (python file-car_number.py)

3) open the garage door whenever it recognises the face of the user.(python file-Face_rec.py)

4) send image whenever the door gets opened (maybe by number plate or by any user) the image gets store in the local drive as well as in the ibm dashboard to access it from the app.

5) Control the garage door and light using the app (used IBM IOT PLATFORM)
